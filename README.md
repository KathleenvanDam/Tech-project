# Tech-project // Filter feature
This project is about building a feature for a matching app. The matching app I created is designed for students who like studying together with other students. To make sure they find the right match, a student can filter on different topics. Some of these topics are age, the thing they are studying and what year they are in. 
This way, students can find each other depending on the homework they need help with, or to find a study buddy to work with.
